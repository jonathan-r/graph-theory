Add your python submission file to `problem-#/submissions` folder.  
Example:
```python
from submission import Submission

class MyAwesomeSubmission(Submission):

    def author(self):
        return 'unique name'

    def run(self, input):
        # input and output format are given in the
        # README file inside problem folder

        ...

        return output
